# Lexogrine HUD Viewer

Lexogrine HUD Viewer is an extension for Lexogrine HUD Manager (1.8+), allowing users to connect to a remote Lexogrine HUD Manager instance in the same network, receive CS:GO data from it and use HUDs remotely. All you have to do (provided you have a proper firewall configuration) is input the Viewer Code from your LHM instance and hit Connect.
